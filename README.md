## Introduction
The Financial News Sentiment Analysis system is designed to process news articles related to financial markets and extract sentiment information. By using NLP techniques and the power of GPT3.5, the system can understand the context, sentiment, and events described in the news articles. This analysis can provide valuable insights for traders, investors, and financial analysts, enabling them to make more informed decisions.

## Features
The system offers the following key features:

1. **Topic Modeling:** Using NLP techniques, the system can identify the main topics discussed in news articles. This feature enables users to understand the dominant themes and subjects in the financial news.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:** The system employs sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment associated with each news article. By analyzing the sentiment, users can gauge the general positivity or negativity surrounding a particular topic or financial instrument.

3. **Event Detection:** The system identifies important events or news within the articles. This feature helps users stay informed about significant developments that may impact the financial markets.

4. **Actionable Insights:** By combining topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and event detection, the system provides actionable insights for financial market analysis. Users can gain a deeper understanding of the sentiment and events driving market movements, allowing them to make more informed investment decisions.
